I use my **jQuery MessageBox** plugin in every single webapp I make, who doesn't need *some kind of alert* at one point or another?
I received some requests and decided to release an update to accomodate them.

### What's new in Version 1.1

* You can now pass a custom element/jQuery Object/Plain HTML to the `input` option *(ie. a `<select>`)*.
* Fail handler now gets the `data` parameter the same way as Done handler does *(you could decide to use those buttons/handlers in a non-ordinary fashion if you like...)*.
* CSS reorganization. I separated the basic CSS from the one you can customize. It's much easier to personalize the MessageBox appearance now.
* Some minor code tweaks here and there.
