### What's new in Version 2.4.1
- Fixed *composer.json* file. PHP 5.4+ required.


#### Fixed *composer.json* file. PHP 5.4+ required.
Some changes introduced in version 2.4.0 of the library broke the compatibility with PHP 5.3. Even if I could easily make some changes in order to support it, I think it's better to drop the support. Who's using PHP 5.3 anymore anyways?
Of course, in case I receive enough requests to support PHP 5.3 (please consider at least to upgrade before requesting it) I will work on that.
