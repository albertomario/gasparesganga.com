### What's new in version 1.5.1
It might be either exciting or dull depending on your preference: you can find this plugin on [Bower](https://bower.io) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)!

##### Bower
`bower install gasparesganga-jquery-loading-overlay`

##### npm
`npm install gasparesganga-jquery-loading-overlay`


### Ok, and what about the new features?
Ehm... there aren't any, really. That's just a release to support Bower and npm, no code change has been made.


### Where has Version 1.5.0 gone?
I accidentally made some confusion with git tags and npm `package.json` file. Long story short, that's a *gosth* version.
