Thanks to some kind GitHub contributions ([this](https://github.com/gasparesganga/jquery-loading-overlay/pull/18) and [this](https://github.com/gasparesganga/jquery-loading-overlay/pull/19)) we have the last minor release before the next major version (yes, it IS coming!).

Version 2.0.0 will include some breaking changes, so it is a good idea to hard-reference the 1.x branch in your current projects instead of any *latest* alias if you are not planning to make any minor adjustment in your code.


### What's new in version 1.6.0
- AMD and CommonJS support: yes, it was about time, my bad!
- Typings for TypeScript: I admit I have no knowledge at all about it, but I trust the definitions provided by a kind contributor.
- Extra *Progress*: it is possible to disable shown text passing boolean value `false` to the `text` option.
- Extra *Progress*: jQuery is referenced through global `jQuery` variable instead of `$` directly
- Main path of Extra *Progress* in `bower.json`
