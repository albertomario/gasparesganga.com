The first Lab release is a little .htaccess/PHP solution to force browsers to reload (*and re-cache!*) modified images, css, javascript and other resources.

I've used it for all my PHP projects in the last couple of years and I've completely forgotten about all the browser cache related problems!


## Download and documentation

Go to the Lab page: [FileVersionName](/labs/file-version-name/)
