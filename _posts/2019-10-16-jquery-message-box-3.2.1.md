Now that's embarrassing... since v3, when I introduced the new gulpfile, in file headers there was a typo and they were showing the name of another plugin of mine ([LoadingOverlay](/labs/jquery-loading-overlay/)).
No real *bugs* have been fixed with this release, but I felt it was necessary.


### What's fixed in version 3.2.1
- The actual name of the plugin - **MessageBox** - in the file headers
