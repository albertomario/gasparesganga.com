### What's new in version 1.5.0
It might be either exciting or dull depending on your preference: you can find this plugin on [Bower](https://bower.io) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)!


### Ok, and what about the new features?
Ehm... there aren't any, really. That's just a release to support Bower and npm, no code change has been made.
