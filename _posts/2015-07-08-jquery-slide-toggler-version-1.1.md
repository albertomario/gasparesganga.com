Following the [first public release of my SlideToggler jQuery Plugin](/posts/jquery-slide-toggler-release/), after I had proudly stated about how *stable and mature that 1.0 public release was*, I took the chance to review the code and make a little but significant upgrade.


### What's new in Version 1.1

I've added a `remove` action, which does exactly what the name suggests: it removes the SlideToggler and reverts the element back to its original state, i.e. an ordinary, boring, old HTML static element.
