This is another bug-fix release. Not a big deal but it was to be expected after the complete *refactoring* I did before releasing this plugin.
The fix enforces the `keepInViewport` flag in the most odd cases, which now works well also with small screens *(ie. mobiles)*.

As usual there are **NO** breaking changes with a *patch* release.
