Since its public debut, my [jQuery LoadingOverlay plugin](/labs/jquery-loading-overlay/) has been the most appreciated release of mine.
I've received a few requests to add some features, and I decided to take some time and make a *new year's eve release*.


### What's new in Version 1.1

#### Font Awesome support
Maybe someone doesn't like the idea of a image *(an animated gif in this case)* used as loading indicator. Maybe those people want to use some scalable vectorial image and not limit them with the maximum size/resolution of a traditional image.  And maybe those people have already included the [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) library to their project. Well, with a brand new `fontawesome` option they will be able to use the icon they prefer.

#### Custom element support
A couple of people asked me if they could show some kind of *countdown* or *feedback for the user* while the LoadingOverlay is on. Since I wanted to keep this plugin as simple and straightforward as possible, I included the support for a `custom` element to be added, leaving to the user the freedom to do what they want with it.
