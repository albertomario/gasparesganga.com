I am sure all of you have seen *(and probably used)* [jQuery UI Accordion](https://jqueryui.com/accordion/).
It certainly does the job pretty well, but the behaviour isn't quite what I wanted.

Add that I am definitely not a fan of jQuery UI and I try to avoid using it *(especially when it's a complete overkill)*, and you get my brand-new<sup>1</sup> [SlideToggler](/labs/jquery-slide-toggler/) jQuery Plugin.

Like the name suggests, it turns a block element into a collapsible sliding panel with a title.
As usual it is fully CSS customizable, lightweight and it exposes **events** to help you write some good *modern* Javascript code.

<br>

*<sup>1</sup> Actually it isn't brand-new at all! Like all my jQuery Plugins, I've written, tested, developed and used it in production for a few months or even years. The result is a fairly stable and mature 1.0 public release...*
