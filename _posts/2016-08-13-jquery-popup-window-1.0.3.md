I have no idea how I overlooked this, but there was a bug in the CSS settings: `pointer-events` was not being set correctly for modal PopupWindows.
It seems like not a big deal actually, but it caused the PopupWindows to be *modal just in appearance*.
Please safely update to version 1.0.3 and forget about it.
