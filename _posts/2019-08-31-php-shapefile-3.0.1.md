How *embarassing* is having to release a bugfix the day after a major release just to fix a couple of typos? Quite a bit actually!

### What has been fixed in Version 3.0.1
- A typo in a variable name introduced with a late *code clean-up before final v3.0.0 release* that was causing a PHP Notice when reading Shapefiles with *Memo* fields.
- Year in the release date of v3.0.0 in CHANGELOG file.


**Still, the big news is [v3.0.0 release](/posts/php-shapefile-3.0.1/), please refer to [it](/posts/php-shapefile-3.0.1/) for breakthrough changes.**
